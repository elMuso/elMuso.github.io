This is the first edition of my music theory book. A compilation of music theory lineal lessons , from a personal perspective and unique. With some redaction errors... and in spanish.

Is the result of endless work and investigation, the best way of saying thanks is sharing it... not this book, but the more recent editions (to someone who reads spanish... of course) :D
